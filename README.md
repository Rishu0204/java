# Java Learning

Java is a Object-Oriented Programming Language,it is a high-level, object-oriented, class-based programming language designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It was developed by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems in 1995. Java is known for its Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA) capability â€” compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.
